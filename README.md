# Deadline-Aware CPU Scheduler Simulation

A simulation of a CPU scheduler that prioritizes processes based on their deadlines and scores. This project demonstrates a real-time scheduling algorithm with process expiration handling and logging capabilities.

## Features

- **Deadline-Aware Scheduling**: Processes are prioritized by score/deadline ratio.
- **Dynamic Queue Management**: Handles process expiration and queue limits.
- **Multithreaded Simulation**: Runs process generation, scheduling, and execution in parallel.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Records all scheduling events with timestamps and metrics.
- **Visualization Script**: Python script to generate performance plots from logs.

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- Python 3.x (for visualization)
- Matplotlib and Pandas (install via `pip install matplotlib pandas`)

## Installation & Usage

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deadline-Aware-CPU-Scheduler.git
cd Deadline-Aware-CPU-Scheduler
```

### Compile the project:
```bash
g++ -o a.out main.cpp classes/cpu.cpp classes/queue.cpp classes/process.cpp classes/scheduler.cpp modules/process_generator.cpp logEvent.cpp -pthread
```

### Run the simulation:
```bash
./a.out
```
Enter the number of CPUs and processes when prompted.

### Generate visualizations after simulation completes:
```bash
python3 plotLog.py
```
Follow prompts to input generated log files (drag & drop supported).

## Key Metrics Tracked

- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of processes meeting deadlines
- **Total Score**: Cumulative score of executed processes
- **Average Waiting Time**
- **Expired Processes Count**

## Example Output

Logs are saved in `logs/log_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.csv` with columns:
```csv
time, event, cpu_id, process_id, execution_time, start_deadline,
end_deadline, total_waiting_time, score, count_of_expire, count_of_misses, total_score
```

The visualization script generates 4 plots in the `plots/` directory:

- **Hit Rate Comparison**
- **Total Scores**
- **Average Waiting Times**
- **Expired Processes Count**
